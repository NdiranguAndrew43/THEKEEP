        CHALLENGE STATEMENT
        ===================

        This project aims to create a web application that streamlines and simplifies home planning, in regards specifically to the groceries. Considering the need to keep track of your home grocery inventory, entertain the below example;
        You arrive home, get the kettle hot for an evening brew of coffee. Then you realize. I forgot to pick up sugar on my way from work. Yet you recall making a mental note to restock it as you scrapped two teaspoons from the sugar dish earlier that day.
        One of many inconveniences we suffer in between hectic work and personal life. This modern age problem created by the fast-paced metropolitan lifestyles is the subject of the project’s focus. 
        Aiming to create a user updated but automatically tracked home inventory tool. With the ability to help users keep tabs on what they may need to restock urgently or even get early warnings (a custom user threshold for notification) of depleted items. The notifications of low running rations can be used to create a downloadable shopping list and a timed notification that coincides with your schedule to act as a reminder.
        That is the main function but is supplemented by a feature that can help plan meals according to the available ingredients. This function is aimed to give simple suggestions and not solve any dietary needs. A database will be created to cross reference with available ingredients and create a likely meal suggestion.
        The project is not specific to locale as the user is responsible for their shopping preferences. Main limiting factor of the project will be internet availability.
